    The Greatest Man in Historyâ€¦ Jesus; Had no servants, yet they called Him Master. Had no degree, yet they called Him Teacher. Had no medicines, yet they called Him Healer. He had no army, yet kings feared Him. He won no military battles, yet He conquered the world. He did not live in a castle, yet they called Him Lord, He ruled no nations, yet they called Him King, He committed no crime, yet they crucified Him. He was buried in a tomb, yet He lives today (Lyle C Rollings III, 2008).

    Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the second person of the Holy Trinity, and the Savior of humanity. He was born in Bethlehem, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, taught about love and forgiveness, and ultimately sacrificed Himself for the sins of the world. His resurrection from the dead is the cornerstone of Christian faith, symbolizing victory over sin and death.
